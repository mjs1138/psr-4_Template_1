<p>The key to Composer-Autoload is the Key <strong>"autoload"</strong> and its associated Value in the projects composer.json file. Example:</p>

<pre><code>
  <strong>"autoload":</strong> {
    "psr-4": {
      "ClassSrcFolder_TopLevelNamespace\\": "app/ClassSrcFolder/"
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Composer uses this value to setup/control the autoloading of classes. The value of the "autoload" key is itself a key/value pair.
    The key <strong>psr-4</strong>" tells Composer what type of autoloading will be used. The value of this key is, again, itself a key/value pair.
    What this key/value says: "Start recursively searching for classes identified w/ the namespace <strong>ClassSrcFolder_TopLevelNamespace</strong> in the directory
    structure <strong>app/ClassSrcFolder/</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The executable code in this project demonstrates this.
    <ul>
    <li>
        The three classes are all at different levels of the directory structure.
    </li>
    <li>But all are in the same name space!</li>
    <li>In index.php all that is needed to have them available is to include a <strong>use</strong> statement constructed of the namespace and the classname.</li>
</ul>
</p>
